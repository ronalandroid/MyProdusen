# Testing Guide

MyProdusen uses **Vitest** for unit, integration, and database-constraint
tests. The current state is `35 test files / 206 passing tests`.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `npm run lint` | Strict TypeScript check (`tsc --noEmit`). Acts as the typecheck gate. |
| `npm run test` | Full test suite. |
| `npm run build` | Production build smoke test. |
| `npm run perf:explain` | `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` the dashboard / report / search queries against `$DATABASE_URL`. Run on staging. |

There is no separate `typecheck` script — `lint` already does it.

## What the suite covers

- **GPS hardening**: missing fields, out-of-range lat/lon, accuracy cap, stale
  timestamps, inactive locations, reject vs pending behaviour.
- **Selfie storage**: structured key path, MIME signature, oversized rejection,
  traversal-safe storage path resolver, base64-never-in-DB.
- **Protected selfie access**: owner allowed, peer denied, ADMIN_HR allowed,
  unauthenticated 401, unknown ID 404, traversal 404.
- **Attendance reports**: RBAC scoping (self/team/all), filter parity with
  CSV, format=csv requires date range, audit log entry on export, row cap
  honours `ATTENDANCE_EXPORT_MAX_ROWS`.
- **Work-location search**: case-insensitive name + address match.
- **DB constraints**: unique per-day attendance index.
- **RBAC + permissions + NIP + leave + KPI + payroll period locks** all
  exercised via dedicated test files.

## Writing new tests

1. Use `tests/helpers/test-utils.ts` to seed users, employees, locations, and
   shifts. Always clean up via the returned IDs.
2. Use `createMockRequest()` instead of constructing raw `Request` objects so
   FormData/JSON encoding stays consistent.
3. For DB-touching tests, scope assertions by employee/division to avoid
   cross-test pollution from the shared dev DB.
4. New unit tests can import via `@/lib/...`, `@/services/...`, etc. For
   `src/server/...` imports, use a relative path from the test file (the
   Vitest alias map omits that prefix).
5. Run `npm run lint && npm run test` before committing.

## Performance smoke test

`npm run perf:explain` prints `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for the canonical queries
(report month range, single-employee window, outside-geo, employee `ilike`,
work-location `ilike`, audit log by user). Look for index usage on
`Attendance_employeeId_checkInTime_idx`, `Attendance_status_checkInTime_idx`,
`Employee_division_idx`, and the geo-status indexes added in `0011`.
